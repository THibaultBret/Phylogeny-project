All the scripts I wrote as part of THE BIOL0019 Advanced Research Project assignment

Some scripts are present in two different version, the second one with a "2" at the end of the name. This is due to the two
distinct filtering strategies which split the approach in two. Counterintuitively, the scripts with a "2" at the end of the
name refer to scripts used in the first filtering strategy (the more lenient one) while all the scripts present in two
versions that do not have a "2" at the end of the name refer to scripts used in the second filtering strategy (the stricter
one). This is the case because these filtering strategies were chronologically developed the other way around, the "second"
filtering strategy being the first and vice-versa. 

Scripts that are not found in two versions are scripts that were used regardless of the filtering strategy.
